<h2>Database functions</h2>

<p>* Can connect to remote database (DB2 as current) very easily. You just need username and password. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>As we know, constantly working with remote database is a pain in ass, you will be very likely locked to interent connection speed</p>

<p>So we need something quicker, which is the local database</p>

<p>We have two types of local databases available for you</p>

<ul><li><p>MapDB, a relatively new key-value based open source database, support encrypted data format, which means other people can not access your data
Since MapDB is relatively new, however with time evolving, it can become more stable </p></li>
<li><p>BerkerleyDB, from Oracle. It is also an open source database. It is a bit of older than MapDB, which means it is more stable. However, the writting performance 
is a not very fast. </p></li>
<li><p>So there is a tradeoff. If you want pretty fast local database, then you probably want to use MapDB. Or if you want it more stable, you can use BerkerleyDB.
The good thing about the two databases is that they are both free and open source. So it is no worry that we have to pay any fees for using them!</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p>The package also supports XML handling functions </p>

<ul><li>It supports insert a single node through insertnode function</li>
<li>It supports insert massive amount of nodes to an xml file through batchinsertnodes function</li>
<li>It supports get the current and children nodes of the xml file</li>
<li>It supports retrieve different node attribute values through getnodevalues function</li>
<li>It supports retrieve node content and its attribute through getelementcontentandattr function</li>
<li>It supports print the xml in a human readable format with prettyxml function</li>
<li>It supports update node attributes with updateattributes function</li>
<li>It support replace the node content with updateentirenode function</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Problems </h1>

<p>There are couple of issues at the current stage. Mainly it can be categorized into two main set of problems. 
e.g. database related problems and the xml related problems.  These two problems sometimes share certain 
amount of similarities, and they are also quite different in some sense. </p>

<h2>Database Problems </h2>

<h3>MAPDB related problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>MapDB is a quite new key-value store based database. It is not very sophisticated. However it claims it is 
amazingly fast. After initial test and compared with several other databases. I found such claim is somehow reasonable. However these are still several issues, mainly are
<ul><li>It does not support a big size of value for one key. After test, I found that it only practically 
support 50M as maximum for one value. This means that if you put a large amount of data related to one 
key. Then the database write would fail.</li>
<li>MapDB uses parallel writting, which means it uses another background thread for writting. If there is 
memory issue, for example, the computer memory is almost used up. Then the MapDB database writting thread
will fail.</li></ul></li>
<li>MapDB is still sensitive to some initial parameters tuning. If the initial parameters are not tuned well
Then the size of the database can grow very quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>BERKELEYDB related problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>Relative to mapdb, berkeleydb is more sophisticated. the database read and write performance are both very stable
However, the main problem related to berkeleydb is that the database write is much slower than mapdb. If the data size 
is very big, it is not very recommended to use berkelydb, if mapdb can be stable enough to use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Matlab and JAVA data types transfer problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>This can be a big problem, if you do not carefully transfer the data type from JAVA to matlab. For example, 
your data size is 1 M rows and 6 columns. if you iteratively transfer every single row and every single column,
this mean you have to run 6 M iterations to complete all data transfer. This can lead to a huge slow of your program
and consuming most of your computer memory!</li>
</ul>

<h2>XML Problems </h2>

<h3>XML processing and Matlab data transfer problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>First, it is fairly quickly for XML file to be 
processed with the XML functions, since it uses DOM tree parsing algorithm, which is known very fast in 
dealing with XML parsing.</li>
<li>The very slow part is coming from the matlab and java data type transfer. If the data transfer process 
can be well tuned, then the speed is acceptable.</li>
<li>There might be a solution to overcome this problem. Since as I know matlab itself has called a lot 
of java codes for completing certian functions. THere also exists data transfer problems. Some experiences 
can be borrowed from the codes which matlab use to call java functions in order to speed up the 
data type transfer process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security Problems </h2>

<p>*Mapdb currently uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA">XTea algorithm</a> for data encryption. It is said that:
It is fast and sound algorithm with 256bit keys. It is highly optimized for MapDB to minimize internal copying.
Other encryption algorithms can be used with some extra coding.
Encryption can be enabled by <a href="http://www.mapdb.org/apidocs/org/mapdb/DBMaker.html#encryptionEnable(java.lang.String)">DBMaker.encryptionEnable(String password)</a>
However, we might need to explore more related to this claim!</p>
